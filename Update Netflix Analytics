%In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Netflix data to answer questions about the data. The following code was written using PostgreSQL.%


#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not the tv shows)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent addition of a movie or tv show to the database?
SELECT MAX (date(date_added))
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. Arrange all the movies and tv shows in alpabetical order.
SELECT title
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
    ORDER BY title asc;
    
#4 Who was the director for the movie "Bright Star"?
SELECT director
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
    ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
    WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';
    
#5 What is the oldest movie or tv show in the database?
SELECT title, release_year
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
    WHERE type = 'Movie'
    ORDER BY release_year asc
    LIMIT 1
